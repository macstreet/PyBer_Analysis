# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Within this new analysis, we merged the data from both the city and ride datasets, and from there, we pulled information on total rides, total drivers, and the number of fares for each city type. The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver was then calculated. 
The analysis was then focused on total fares and isolated to a date range of January 1st, 2019 to April 28th, 2019. Within this dataframe, the sum of each week's fares was calculated per city type, and a multiple-line chart visualization was created to demonstrate the findings.

## Results

### Urban Cities Results
Urban cities had the most PyBer usage of all three city types, by far. In urban cities 1,625 rides were given, there are 2,405 drivers on the road, and a total of $39,854.38 in fares. Urban city PyBer rides are, on average, cheaper than the average ride in a suburban or rural area, at $24.53. Also, PyBer drivers in rural cities earn less money per ride, an average of $16.57 per ride. 

### Suburban Cities Results
Suburban areas are right in the middle ground of PyBer usage between the three city types. There were 625 total rides given, 490 drivers are on the road, and a total of $19,356.33 in fares were made. The average fare per ride was $30.97 and the average fare per driver was $39.50.

### Rural Cities Results
Rural cities saw the lowest PyBer usage, but also had the highest fares per ride and driver. There were a total of 128 rides provided, 78 drivers, and a total of $4,327.93 in fares collected for rural cities. However, the average fare per ride and per driver was the highest of all three cities, at $34.62 and $55.49, respectively.

### Total Fares by City Type - Week by Week:
As shown in the line plot below, there is a significant disparity between fares earned in rural cities versus urban cities. This plot shows that suburban cities are even at the risk of continuing to widen their disparity from the urban cities as well.

## Summary
Upon review of these results, there are three recommendations for how to address disparities among the city types:
### Recommendation #1: Adjust fares to match demand
In rural cities, the average fare per ride was about $10 more than the average fare per ride in an urban city. This is likely because riders are going longer distances in rural areas. One recommendation is to decrease fare rates in rural areas in order to increase the likelihood that someone will use PyBer in a rural city. In order to offset this cost, it is also recommended to increase fares in urban areas.
 
### Recommendation #2: Cap the number of drivers  
In urban cities, drivers make about 58% less than drivers in suburban cities, despite the average fare per ride being only ~21% less in urban cities than in suburban cities. The primary reason for this is the number of drivers on the road compared to the demand for rides. It is recommended that PyBer place a cap on the number of drivers in a given area, based on the population size and demand for rides. By limiting the number of drivers in an area, PyBer can ensure their employees/drivers are able to make a sustainable wage.

### Recommendation #3: Incentivize driving in rural cities
If you were to move forward with Recommendation #1, you may see an increase in demand for drivers. If you are unable to fill that demand with the local population, it is recommended that you incentivize drivers in urban and suburban drivers to drive in rural areas. Incentives can look like sign-on bonuses, commute mileage compensation, increased percentage to the driver per fare, etc.
